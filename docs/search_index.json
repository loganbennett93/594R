["literature.html", "Chapter 2 Literature", " Chapter 2 Literature Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems are increasingly used by cities around the world due to their ability to address high passenger demand without exorbitant upfront costs. The cost savings come from the fact that BRTs operate on Right-of-Way category B (ROW-B) facilities with separated designated lanes that are subject to traffic control at intersections. In this way, buses have an unimpeded corridor on which to complete trips. However, the subjection to traffic control creates variability in the operating times of these systems, and several strategies have been developed and implemented to increase their reliability and operating times.One such strategy is the use of Transit Signal Priority (TSP), which alters priority at signalized intersections to provide for reduced running times between stops and a more even distribution of headways. In general, TSP seeks to improve operations by increasing the efficiency with which buses navigate signalized intersections, but it can be distinguished by a few classes (Delgado et al. (2015)): 1.Active or passive priority. Active priority involves timing adjustments made according to real-time data. Passive priority involves offline measures, such as optimized cycle lengths, based off of historical data. 2.Total, partial, or relative priority. In total priority, control actions such as phase jumping, phase insertion, green extension, or early termination of the red seek to create zero delay for buses. Partial priority limits control actions to those that provide less interruptions to other traffic, such as green extensions and early termination of the red. In relative priority, buses compete with general traffic at lights for priority. 3.Unconditional or conditional priority. Unconditional priority means buses receive priority at all times whereas conditional priority only provides buses with needed control measures when the buses are late. Adaptive signal priority involves real-time control adjustments made in order to optimize the throughput of both buses and general traffic,in which the delay of each is considered and a controller decides on a response most pertinent to the current traffic conditions. Ni et al. (2020) compares adaptive signal priority with active and passive priority, whereas Al-Deek et al. (2017) groups it with unconditional and conditional priority. Many studies have been done to determine the effects of various TSP strategies and configurations. In general, TSP strategies have been found to improve performance of transit systems such as BRT in a number of ways, including reduced delay, improved reliability, and mitigated effects on general traffic. Ishaq and Cats (2020) used a set of trip data from a BRT system in Haifa, Israel to study the relation between service reliability, fleet management, and service utilization. They found that full and unconditional traffic signal priority given at all signals led to an 18% reduction in total vehicle trip time and contributed to a 60% reduction in the standard deviation of trip time. Similarly, Al-Deek et al. (2017) found that compared to several other TSP strategies, BRT with unconditional TSP provided the best travel time, speed, number of stops, and delay enhancements but resulted in significant crossing street delays, especially at major intersections with high traffic demand. While the unconditionalTSP strategy was found effective in termsof the delay of the BRT system, concerns rise over the effects on side-street traffic if unconditional priority consistently gives right of way to the buses. Liu et al. (2018) clarified that “signal priorities are provided more efficiently and on a more informed basis, with fewer impacts on other traffic operations than the use of unconditional TSP.”The implementation of unconditional TSP may only be practical where crossing street volumes are low, and must reasonably be done in conjunction with studies of how non-transit traffic is effected, as each system’s corridors have differing needs based off of demand and geometry. Liu et al. (2018) performed a study using transit operation data from a bus route found in Salt Lake County, Utah. A microscopic simulation was used to test GPS-based TSP scenarios. GPS-based TSP uses a GPS to achieve real-time (active) bus locating and advanced wireless communication technologies to achieve comprehensive analysis of operating information. Then a data-driven optimization method was implemented to understand the effects of flexible granting of signal priority across several models. They found that overall, BRT travel time decreased in all models where TSP was employed when compared to the base BRT model. Al-Deek et al. (2017) also used simulation models to compare several scenarios. Using field data from a corridor in Orlando, Florida, they found that BRT with conditional TSP that was engaged when the buses were 3 minutes behind experienced significantly improved travel times, average speed, and average total delay per vehicle, with minor effects on crossing street delays, when compared with BRT systems with no TSP or 5-minute conditional thresholds.These results indicate that TSP methods are effective in reducing delay. However, they ignore the important aspect of system reliability, which is critical to improving running times and maintaining ridership. Yang et al. (2015) performed a study of a pre-detective TSP strategy for BRT with active priority coordination between primary and secondary intersections using data from Changzhou, China. Using microscopic simulation, they tested three scenarios (traditional TSP, pre-detective TSP, and pre-detective TSP with coordination) against a no TSP base scenario. They found that pre-detective signal priority with coordination was most effective, with bus intersection delay decreasing by 67.4% and headway adherence improving by about 40% when compared with a no TSP strategy, while reducing normal traffic delay. Delgado et al. (2015) studied station and interstation control jointly to determine an optimal control strategy for a single-service transit corridor applied to a high-frequency transit system, with the goal of evaluating effects over the whole corridor. A strategy of green extension with holding buses at stops was shown to produce a greater reduction in waiting times for users, as well as reducing variability and improving headway adherence. Ni et al. (2020) performed a study of passive TSP control for a BRT system in Taichung, Taiwan. Microsimulation incorporated with a genetic algorithm was developed to coordinate signal offsets along an arterial with BRT operations, with the purpose of balancing improvements in BRT system delays and changes to LOS of other traffic. They found that passive TSP control can reduce approximately 22% of transit delay, with the smallest delay experienced in conjunction with a strategy of a three-minute scheduled headway. Additionally, the 3-minute departure headway scenario exhibited the best service reliability among the scenarios, with a headway stability near 100%. These studies indicate the need to view BRT system performance in terms of both system delay and reliability. Especially when viewed across an entire system, it is possible for running times to remain consistent while reliability of individual buses is low. In particular, a bunching phenomenon may occur from a positive feedback loop of fluctuations in passenger demand and traffic conditions (Delgado et al. (2015)).In scenarios where bunching is a problem, it may not be sufficient to base control strategies off of a schedule, rather on reliable operations. This may prove difficult in implementation. For instance, Ishaq and Cats (2020) noted that the procurement agreement between the public transport authority in Israel and the incumbent operator implies that a schedule-based control strategy is required, as opposed to a headway-based (reliability-based) control strategy. However, when TSP control strategies are reliability-based, measures of reliability increase and the bunching phenomenon can be reduced. Cats (2014) performed a study of a regularity-driven operation scheme in Stockholm, Sweden to improve reliability and mitigate bus bunching. Using a series of field experiments and measuring performance with regularity indicators such as headway coefficient of variation, headway adherence, and average excess waiting time, he determined that a headway-based control strategy was effective in not only narrowing the headway distribution from the previous schedule-bases strategy, but also reducing waiting times, more evenly distributing dwell times, and maintaining running times. Chen et al. (2012) also performed a headway-based study to measure the effects of real-time preventive operations control. They found that reliability is improved with lower permitted headway deviations and lower fluctuations of running times. When real-time information is used to predict service reliability and trigger preventive control, such as reduced dwell time and speed adjustments, bus bunching can be reduced. Both of these studies effectively demonstrate that solutions to bunching and other reliability-based operational problems are most effectively addressed through reliability-based control strategies. However, little has been done to evaluate the relationship between methods of TSP in a reliability-based control strategy. A study of TSP strategies with a focus on headway distribution could prove useful in gauging the benefits of TSP in a headway-based system, such as the UVX BRT system in Utah Valley. References "],
["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods 3.1 Data", " Chapter 3 Methods We modified a dataset provided by Utah Transit Authority (UTA) to verify the affects of several TSP strategies on headway variation of the UVX BRT system. This BRT system is a 10 mile line between Provo and Orem and was open for public use as of January 9, 2019. The demographics of this area are particularly marked by the presence of two large universities in the area, Brigham Young University in Provo and Utah Valley University in Orem. With over 30,000 students in enrolled in each respective institution each year, a great deal of traffic demand is created between students traveling to and from school, especially considering the fact that housing and job demands are driven by students. For this reason there is a decent amount of UVU students who live in Provo, and the need to make the Provo-Orem commute causes considerable delay during peak hours. In conjunction with servicing other demographics of the population, servicing student needs was a large factor in the decision to implement a BRT system in this area. 3.1 Data We created an analysis dataset from UTA’s raw dataset that included timepoint data for all UVX BRT trips from January 2, 2019 to December 30, 2019. The dataset was cleaned and reoriented to reflect data that would be useful in analyzing the distribution of headways over different times of day, locations, and TSP thresholds. We retained within the dataset routes, trips, stops, and vehicles. We simplified the format of these datapoints and created a new variable to hold information regarding reliability, or the difference between scheduled departures and actual departures. we also changed the level descriptions of the TSP thresholds. ## # A tibble: 1,015,863 x 24 ## NEW_Date Block Trip Vehicle Route Direction `Time Point` Schedule ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1/2/19 2400 04:17 17110 830X NB TO OR~ PROVFRST 04:17 ## 2 1/2/19 2400 04:17 17110 830X NB TO OR~ 400----S 04:19 ## 3 1/2/19 2400 04:17 17110 830X NB TO OR~ CNTR--ST 04:20 ## 4 1/2/19 2400 04:17 17110 830X NB TO OR~ 300----N 04:21 ## 5 1/2/19 2400 04:17 17110 830X NB TO OR~ ACADSQUR 04:22 ## 6 1/2/19 2400 04:17 17110 830X NB TO OR~ JOA-QUIN 04:24 ## 7 1/2/19 2400 04:17 17110 830X NB TO OR~ BYU-CMPS 04:26 ## 8 1/2/19 2400 04:17 17110 830X NB TO OR~ BYU----N 04:28 ## 9 1/2/19 2400 04:17 17110 830X NB TO OR~ BYU-STAD 04:29 ## 10 1/2/19 2400 04:17 17110 830X NB TO OR~ 2230---N 04:31 ## # ... with 1,015,853 more rows, and 16 more variables: DepartureTime &lt;chr&gt;, ## # Status &lt;chr&gt;, Reliability &lt;chr&gt;, Dwell &lt;chr&gt;, Travel &lt;chr&gt;, Hour &lt;chr&gt;, ## # Headway &lt;chr&gt;, REL_sec &lt;chr&gt;, `TT+Dwe;;_sec` &lt;chr&gt;, Dwell_sec &lt;chr&gt;, ## # TT_sec &lt;chr&gt;, `tot TT+Dwell_sec` &lt;chr&gt;, `TP #` &lt;chr&gt;, Threshold &lt;chr&gt;, ## # ChangeDay &lt;chr&gt;, Peak &lt;chr&gt; ## # A tibble: 1,015,863 x 12 ## route direction trip timepoint vehicle date time ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; ## 1 830X NB 04:17 PROVFRST 17110 2019-01-02 2019-01-02 04:17:29 ## 2 830X NB 04:17 400----S 17110 2019-01-02 2019-01-02 04:19:48 ## 3 830X NB 04:17 CNTR--ST 17110 2019-01-02 2019-01-02 04:20:42 ## 4 830X NB 04:17 300----N 17110 2019-01-02 2019-01-02 04:21:29 ## 5 830X NB 04:17 ACADSQUR 17110 2019-01-02 2019-01-02 04:22:18 ## 6 830X NB 04:17 JOA-QUIN 17110 2019-01-02 2019-01-02 04:24:10 ## 7 830X NB 04:17 BYU-CMPS 17110 2019-01-02 2019-01-02 04:25:43 ## 8 830X NB 04:17 BYU----N 17110 2019-01-02 2019-01-02 04:28:23 ## 9 830X NB 04:17 BYU-STAD 17110 2019-01-02 2019-01-02 04:29:15 ## 10 830X NB 04:17 2230---N 17110 2019-01-02 2019-01-02 04:31:22 ## # ... with 1,015,853 more rows, and 5 more variables: schedule &lt;dttm&gt;, ## # reliability &lt;drtn&gt;, dwell &lt;drtn&gt;, travel &lt;drtn&gt;, threshold &lt;fct&gt; We also calculated elapsed headways, discrepancies between scheduled and actual headways, and cumulative dwell times on trips, as these are potential factors to verify the effects of manipulation on TSP thresholds.

The histograms above show that comparison of headway discrepancy for the respective TSP thresholds considered across the entire bus route yields little visual implication of a difference in distributions. The only noticeable difference between the distributions are the frequencies of headway discrepancies for the respective thresholds due to the varying lengths of time that each was in effect. A one-way ANOVA indicates that the means of these distributions are not significantly different, as shown below. ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: discrepancy ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## threshold 3 8.5565e+04 28522 1.2736 0.2815 ## Residuals 808058 1.8096e+10 22395 An F-test of the headway discrepancy as a function of TSP thresholds indicates a large p-value of 0.2815, which provides no evidence that there is a difference in mean discrepancy between the thresholds when considered in the context of the entire route. Further investigation of the data may explain differences that are seen between TSP thresholds but that do not significantly change the means of their respective distributions. To investigate the effects of TSP thresholds on headway reliability, a number of things can be done, including splitting up the routes by direction and location and performing additional statistical tests on the data to analyze for variation between groups. A preliminary analysis of the data split in that way is shown below. 4.1 Grouped Distributions A comparison of headway distributions for separate locations and directions of travel may be insightful into the effects of TSP at different points along the UVX route. For this purpose, the route has been partitioned into the following 12 groups. Groups were chosen to capture groups of riders from four separate sections of the route, as well as to address major intersections where TSP may have more of an influence in one of two directions. In order to provide better comparisons of NB and SB routes, the PROVO groups do not include the stops south of Provo Central Station, since they only appear in the SB trips.

The first four histograms show the UVU, UNI, BYU, and PROVO groups, respectively. The second four histograms show the same groups for NB trips, and the last four show the same groups for the SB trips. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

Inspection of the histograms indicates that the distributions of headway discrepancies for the groups tends to be around 1 minute. There is some variation between the groups, though the distributions appear to be somewhat normal. A table of group means and standard deviations is given below. Route Mean SD PROVO 0.8520017 138.86845 BYU 1.1828720 141.24096 UNI 1.1101580 145.13731 UVU 1.0456957 156.21179 PROVONB 0.0698868 97.97882 BYUNB 0.9358277 113.98647 UNINB 1.4900025 146.13385 UVUNB 1.9409111 185.90801 PROVOSB 1.7327866 173.75146 BYUSB 1.4233321 163.46176 UNISB 0.7339238 144.14318 UVUSB 0.1163299 117.70067 The results of splitting up the trips by location are expected. There is not a large variation of discrepancies when routes are compared with both their northbound and southbound trips included. This is likely due to the trend seen in the northbound and southbound groups. The mean discrepancy increases in the northbound trips as the buses travel from the start of the trip in Provo towards the end of the trip near UVU. The same trend is seen in the southbound trips from UVU to Provo. The standard deviations of headway discrepancies behave the same way. This indicates the cumulative nature of headway discrepancy. As buses progress along their routes, irregularities tend to compound. This is may be due to problems such as the bunching phenomenon discussed in the literature. By means of data visualization and exploration, we have determined that the data is organized in a way that meets assumptions for further statistical tests. We are specifically interested in the distributions of headway discrepancy for the four respective TSP thresholds. Initial analysis above indicated that there is no statistical difference between mean headway discrepancy for the respective thresholds when considered in the context of the entire bus route. However, we may be able to evaluate certain locations along the route where TSP thresholds do affect the headway discrepancy. If statistical differences do appear, this may indicate that TSP thresholds do play a role for certain portions of the UVX route. 4.2 statistical Tests on Grouped Distributions For each of the 12 partitioned groups of the UVX route, a boxplot comparing headway discrepancy by TSP threshold will be shown along with an ANOVA table. The differences between these groups are difficult to determine based off of visuals alone, but the F-tests can help determine which, if any, differences are significant. If significant differences are observed, then the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc procedure for multiple comparisons of unplanned differences will be used to evaluate them. From those analyses, conclusions will be made about the effect of TSP thresholds on sections of the UVX route.The results of F-tests run to compare TSP thresholds within the partitioned groups are shown below. ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: discrepancy ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## threshold 3 38586 12862 0.6671 0.5722 ## Residuals 216828 4180759708 19282 ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: discrepancy ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## threshold 3 19367 6455.8 0.3238 0.8082 ## Residuals 252297 5030198546 19937.6 ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: discrepancy ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## threshold 3 3789 1262.9 0.0599 0.9808 ## Residuals 201854 4252553029 21067.5 ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: discrepancy ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## threshold 3 8305 2768.3 0.1133 0.9524 ## Residuals 189288 4625364807 24435.6 visualization of the cumulative headway discrepancies for the respective TSP thresholds shows little variation between the locations, and nothing that strongly indicates differences between the effects of TSP thresholds. Results from the F-tests indicate no evidence of a difference between mean headway discrepancies based on TSP threshold in any of the above groups, as indicated by the high reported p-values (0.5722 for the PROVO group, 0.8082 for the BYU group, 0.9808 for the UNI group, and 0.9524 for the UVU group). This finding is not surprising considering the cumulative nature of the headway discrepancy when a group is near the start or end of a trip. The NB and SB discrepancies likely mitigate each other to a certain extent. We may find different results when analysis is run on the NB or SB groups. The results of F-tests run to compare TSP thresholds within the partitioned NB groups are shown below. ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: discrepancy ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## threshold 3 11512 3837.4 0.3988 0.7539 ## Residuals 114827 1104890857 9622.2 ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: discrepancy ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## threshold 3 13260 4420.1 0.3397 0.7966 ## Residuals 124439 1619085318 13011.1 ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: discrepancy ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## threshold 3 5291 1763.7 0.0825 0.9696 ## Residuals 100443 2146412008 21369.5 ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: discrepancy ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## threshold 3 20518 6839 0.1976 0.8981 ## Residuals 96417 3337166355 34612 The results of F-tests run to compare TSP thresholds within the partitioned SB groups are shown below. ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: discrepancy ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## threshold 3 56187 18729 0.6211 0.6013 ## Residuals 101997 3075689688 30155 ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: discrepancy ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## threshold 3 20009 6669.7 0.25 0.8614 ## Residuals 127854 3411084056 26679.5 ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: discrepancy ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## threshold 3 5384 1794.6 0.0864 0.9675 ## Residuals 101407 2106105845 20768.8 ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: discrepancy ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## threshold 3 3.834e+03 1278 0.0921 0.9644 ## Residuals 92867 1.288e+09 13870 The same pattern of cumulative headway discrepancy is seen by comparison of the routes, with the mean headway discrepancy slightly increasing towards the end of each respective NB or SB route. However, results of the F-tests on the groups partitioned by both location and direction were similar to those of the groups partitioned by location alone. A table of p-values for all twelve groups is shown below. Route Group p-value PROVO 0.5722 BYU 0.8082 UNI 0.9808 UVU 0.9524 PROVO (NB) 0.7539 BYU (NB) 0.7966 UNI (NB) 0.9696 UVU (NB) 0.8981 PROVO (SB) 0.6013 BYUSB (SB) 0.8614 UNISB (SB) 0.9675 UVUSB (SB) 0.9644 In none of the groups is there any evidence of a difference between mean headway discrepancy when accounting for the four different TSP thresholds. Even in the PROVO group, which had the lowest p-value, the differences between TSP thresholds is insignificant. Estimates of those differences are shown in the following Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test. There is no indication of differences in headway discrepancy for any comparison of TSP thresholds, as all p-values reported are all very high. This is consistent across each of the 12 groups, and this analysis is shown here only for reference. ## Tukey multiple comparisons of means ## 95% family-wise confidence level ## ## Fit: aov(formula = PROVOlm) ## ## $threshold ## diff lwr upr p adj ## 5 min-No TSP -0.9902185 -5.014180 3.033743 0.9216924 ## 2 min-No TSP -0.8463989 -4.846422 3.153624 0.9482872 ## Always-No TSP 1.0571259 -4.391204 6.505456 0.9594357 ## 2 min-5 min 0.1438197 -1.457287 1.744927 0.9956733 ## Always-5 min 2.0473445 -1.983494 6.078183 0.5597832 ## Always-2 min 1.9035248 -2.103416 5.910466 0.6138108 This analysis has shown no evidence that TSP thresholds provide a significant effect on the headway distribution of buses belonging to the UVX BRT system when accounting for location and direction alone. There may be a number of confounding factors not included in this analysis. For example, variability in ridership may affect dwell times and the ability for buses to meet acceptable headways without triggering TSP in certain locations. A simple comparison of cumulative headway distribution by trip direction may indicate this possible effect. The cumulative headway discrepancy plots below show differences between mean headway discrepancies of the UVU, UNI, BYU, or PROVO groups when compared to their respective two-way, NB, or SB counterparts. It can easily be seen from the plots that in combining the NB and SB trips for each group (PROVO, BYU, UNI, or UVU), the discrepancies do not vary much, likely due to the opposite effect of compounding irregularities from the trip origin. However, there are some differences between the NB and SB groups that are worth noting. In the plot of the NB routes, there appears to be a fairly even distribution of headway discrepancies along the route. No one group appears to be more influential to the discrepancy, but the discrepancy does increase between all sections when buses travel from Provo to UVU. However, in the plot of the SB routes, the cumulative headway distribution varies less between the UNI, BYU, and PROVO sections. This smaller variance demonstrates that headway deviations are not particularly exacerbated during that portion of the bus trips, which could be due to lower demand in the SB trips past the BYU area, as much of the ridership is likely students traveling between BYU and UVU. Further analysis of the relationships between TSP, location, and dwell time could provide more meaningful insights. Other factors that could be influential to the data include time of year and time of day. Where this analysis was performed considering the geospatial aspects of the timepoint data, it did not consider geotemporal aspects of the BRT system. Time of year was somewhat included in the analysis due to the fact that the different TSP thresholds were in effect at different times of the year. It is possible that TSP thresholds could be more significant during peak or off-peak periods of the day, and this possibility was ignored in the data analysis presented here. "],
