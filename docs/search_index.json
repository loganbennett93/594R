However, the distributions of the four thresholds were not the same. Further investigation of the data may explain differences that are seen between TSP thresholds but that do not significantly change the means of their respective distributions. To investigate the effects of TSP thresholds on headway reliability, a number of things can be done, including splitting up the routes by direction and location and performing additional statistical tests on the data to analyze for variation between groups. A preliminary analysis of the data split in that way is shown below. 4.1 Grouped Distributions A comparison of headway distributions for separate locations and directions of travel may be insightful into the effects of TSP at different points along the UVX route. For this purpose, the route has been partitioned into the following 12 groups. In order to provide better comparisons of NB and SB routes, the PROVO group does not include the stops south of Provo Central Station, since they only appear in the SB trips.

Histograms for the separate groups will be created for initial visualization of the data, so as to inspect for differences among the groups. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.
